### ==Epilepsy Warning== in end sequence!
A website in raw HTML/CSS/JS with a very, very questionable escape-room-style sequence. Players beware of cringe.

Load up `index.html` and... bask in it for awhile.

## ...Why?
I was trying to understand the web from its base technologies, and started writing raw HTML/CSS/JS. This was my first ever attempt at making something interactive that a browser could load.

Hence all the random layouts, divs, colors and images; I was just trying out every basic feature I could think of.
